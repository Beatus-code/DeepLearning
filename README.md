Deep Learning in Convolution Neural Network
The aim of the experiment was to investigated the following:
1. Data Scaling using Mean Subtraction vs Normalization
2. Weight Initialization( Xavier vs He Initialization)
3. Layer Architecture
4. Gradient Optimization
5. Activation Function and
6. Regularization
